# NoteTaker
This application allows the user to create, save, and delete notes.

## Description
The application presents the user with a welcome screen. The next page shows two inputs: one for title and one for text. The top right of the screen has a new note button, and a save note button once the user starts to type. Once the user saves a note, the note will be displayed on the left side of the screen. A delete note button appears next to the saved note and, once clicked, will delete the note. The notes are being saved to a JSON file on the backend.
